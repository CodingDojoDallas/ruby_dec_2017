players = Player.all
players.each do |player|
    puts player.name
    puts player.team.name
    puts player.team.stadium
    puts player.team.mascot
end

This performs one query to get all players, and then 498*3 = 1494 queries to get team information.

players = Player.includes(:team)
players.each do |player|
    puts player.name
    puts player.team.name
    puts player.team.stadium
    puts player.team.mascot
end

This performs only two queries, one to get the players, and one to retrieve their team information.

players = Player.includes(:team).where("teams.name = 'Chicago Bulls'").references(:team)

players = Player.joins(:team).select("players.*", "teams.name as TeamName", "teams.stadium as stadium").where("teams.stadium = 'Staples Center'")

teams = Team.joins(:players).select("teams.*, players.name").where("players.name LIKE 'Z%'")

teams = Team.includes(:players).select("teams.*, players.name").where("players.name LIKE 'Z%'").references(:players)
